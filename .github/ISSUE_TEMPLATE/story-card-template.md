# Story Card Request

**Project:**    
**Card Title:**        
**Card Document:** (link here)        

## Milestones

### Setup
- [ ] Create Card Document from [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aNBU5m5vc7coXbHzItJB9sUMAGufMVYEJZqXUkY40Gc/edit#) and link above     

### Type of data processing / analysis this story card uses 
Each card can belong to one or more categories listed below

- [x] descriptive - simple data (re)-representation, doing summary statistics belongs to this category, we do this for all data sets      
- [ ] explanatory - testing hypotheses and / or comparing data points     
- [ ] predictive - any regression, model fitting, classification or clustering tasks      
- [ ] prescriptive - when you want to recommend any action to be taken (we do this rarely, if at all)      

### Data documentation and proposed analysis
- [ ] Document [metadata](https://forms.gle/7aL8U3Y9ANNz9oda7)       
- [ ] Decide whether to load to database or S3 with proper metadata documentation       
- [ ] Review metadata and proposed data analysis      

### Set up data processing development environment   
- [ ] Clone repo from [template] (https://github.com/karenng-civicsoftware/HackORDataScienceTemplate)       
- [ ] Set up access to GitHub repo for all team members
- [ ] Set up a container from a suitable version of the [Dockerfile template](https://github.com/karenng-civicsoftware/HackORDataScienceTemplate/blob/master/build/Dockerfile)       
- [ ] Prototyping and testing analysis proposals       
- [ ] Review additional proposed data analysis identified through prototyping       
- [ ] Write code for reproducible data processing steps with proper version control & data lineage    
- [ ] Data science results produced and documented      
- [ ] Data science peer reviewed        

### Build APIs
- [ ] Database deployed to CIVIC Cloud      
- [ ] Data science results available through API with all needed calculations, filters and queries       
- [ ] Basic API in container       
- [ ] Basic API deployed to CIVIC Cloud       
- [ ] TBD process for API design - standardization?        
- [ ] API endpoint with all needed calculations, filters and queries        

### Data visualization:
- [ ] Clear concept        
- [ ] All components needed available in [Storybook](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/)       
- [ ] Components available in [Storybook](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/) demonstrate all needed features      
- [ ] Follows data visualization and interface guidelines available in [Storybook](https://hackoregon.github.io/civic/)        

### Design
